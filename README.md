# Task description:
The task is to create classes ImmutableLinkedList and ImmutableArrayList (dynamic array), which implement the interface ImmutableList.
Collections are Immutable, so changing the state of an existing collection is prohibited.
All operations that are supposed to change the state of a collection in some way must return a new collection.
Also, using ImmutableLinkedList, Queue and Stack classes must be implemented - these classes should not be Immutable
